## Overview ##

__What's this?__

It's a GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by me, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe or any other company/publisher. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you!

__How do I use it?__

Inside of BattleScribe please choose the "Add data index url" option from the *Manage Data* screen and paste in the following URL: https://github.com/dstretch/Seven-Days-to-the-River-Rhine/releases/latest/download/Seven-Days-to-the-River-Rhine.latest.bsi

Now once you update your data you should get the latest updates.
